Problem 1
 - Part a:
 - Part b: "clean" gets rid of all the files ending with ".o" and "~", and also the files "shape1" and "shape2".
   	   ??? trick question on "make shape1" it sholdn't work?
 - Part c: .PHONY explicitly tells "Make" that the actions/commands following it are not associated with files, so the command does not make any files after running them (like normal "Make" commands make an object file or something). It is also used to avoid conflict of external files/targets in the same directory of the same name (ie. if you had a file called "clean", .PHONY runs "make clean" as expected).
 - Part d: 2, 4
